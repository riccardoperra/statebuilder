# rstate

`Rstate` is a state management library built on the top of SolidJS reactivity.

Rstate allows the user to extend its functionalities with plugins. This is the main concept of this state manager. 

It's built
to be an extremely modular system, with an API that allows you to add methods, utilities and custom behaviors in an easier way.

Of course, this come with a built-in TypeScript support.

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```
