`StateBuilder` is an agnostic state management library built on the top of SolidJS reactivity.

It's built to be an **extremely modular system**, with an API that allows you to add methods, utilities and custom behaviors to your store
in an easier way. Of course, this come with a built-in TypeScript support.

Solid already provides the primitives to build a state manager system thanks to signals and stores. What's missing is a
well-defined pattern to follow while building your application.

Thanks to `StateBuilder` you can **compose** the approach you like to handle your state.
